# Using JS

Simply knowing JavaScript is not enough.  The true challenge comes in trying to use it to solve real problems.  But what does that even mean?  The art of practical programming begins with the mastery of three primary skills:
1. _Understanding the Challenge_:  Before attempting to solve a challenge, you must have a thorough understanding of what you are trying to achieve and the best strategies for your use case.
2. _Domain Mapping_: Abstracting real-world challenges into data a program can manipulate, and back again once the program has terminated.
3. _Algorithmics_: Data + Manipulations. Learning to mutate program state from an initial state to a meaningful final state using the tools provided by JavaScript.

These skills are as important as they are challenging.  Before moving on to building full applications it is helpful to isolate and master them.  The projects, exercises, and resources in this repository will help you build the problem-solving foundations you need to effectively develop web applications.
